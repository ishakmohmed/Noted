### [2] Introduction
Noted! is a full stack note taking web app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It has got all the features that you need in a note taking app while being simplistic. This app is a full-fledged, complete app which means you can make this app as your go-to note taking app from now onwards. It has a JWT authentication and a classic black and white UI. You can add/edit/delete note(s). Also, it is mobile responsive and no design library is used to implement this since I used plain CSS to build the UI to improve my CSS skills.
