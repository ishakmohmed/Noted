[5] Intro: Noted! is a full stack note taking web app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It has got all the features that you need in a note taking app while being simplistic.
This app is a full-fledged, complete app which means you can make this app as your go-to note taking app from now onwards. It has a JWT authentication and a classic black and white UI. You can add/edit/delete note(s).
Also, it is mobile responsive and no design library is used to implement this since I used plain CSS to build the UI to improve my CSS skills.

* Node.js
* Express.js

* Mongoose

* React Hooks
* Authentication
